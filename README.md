### Prerequisites & Installation

Before you can run this project you will need to install several software programs to your machine. If you already
have these programs you can omit this section.

- Java 11
- Gradle >= 6.3
- Docker
- MongoDB

#### Java 11
 
This project runs with Java version 11 and its required to get started developing with this application.
You can download Java 11 through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) the popular package manager for Mac.

With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed you can download and install Java with:
```shell script
$ brew update
$ brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
$ brew cask install homebrew/cask-versions/java11
```

You can validate your installation with:

```shell script
$ java -version
```

#### Gradle 

Once you have Java successfully installed you will need to download and install [Gradle](https://gradle.org). Gradle is a build manager
for Java and helps with managing dependencies, packaging up the executable Jar file, and running unit tests!

Install Gradle through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) using the following command:

```shell script
$ brew install gradle
```

#### Docker

// TODO

#### Mongo DB

Lastly you will need to have [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed since it is the primary database for this Application. Luckily you can
install [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/) with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) by executing the following command: 

```shell script
$ brew tap mongodb/brew
$ brew install mongodb-community@4.2
```
